title: Getting Started With Home Automation
---

In my first post [Getting Started With IoT](/Getting-Started-With-IoT/) I showed how you can make your first Internet of Things circuit and control a LED over the internet. While I still think that is pretty awesome, it is not really home automation. It does lay the groundwork for my very first home automation project, though, which is being able to control my garage door from anywhere and know whether it is opened or closed. This project costs a fraction of the commercial offers and is still relatively simple to build.
