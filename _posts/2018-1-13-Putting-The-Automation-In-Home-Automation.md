title: Putting the Automation in Home Automation
---

In my last post [Getting Started With Home Automation](/Getting-Started-With-Home-Automation/) I set up a way to control my garage door from my phone. Though I consider this part of home automation, I haven't truly automated anything. Nothing is happening on it's own, I must interact with my phone to open and close the door or to see what its current state is. Now lets add some automation into this project.

## Goals for the Project

I live in Ohio where the temperatures outside can get bitterly cold during the winter. My garage is not heated, so anything stored in it can and will get very cold. This works out really well for most of the year as our garage acts like a giant refrigerator where I can store beer and other beverages. The problem comes when the temperatures dip well below freezing and the garage acts more like a freezer then a refrigerator and all of the drinks begin to freeze. No one likes to find their delicious beer frozen or even worse, exploded. So in this project I will continue to build upon the wifi garage door and add a feature to also monitor the temperature of the garage. To automate this process, I want to get a notification on my phone when the temperature dips below 32F. That way I then can either make sure door is closed or move the beverages inside.
